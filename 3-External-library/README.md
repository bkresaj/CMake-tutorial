## Introduction

In this folder we will explore more about how to include external libraries into our project.

In FetchContent folder you can check how to include external dependencies using FetchContet module.

To try and to build the executable go to FetchContent folder and write this command:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make TestProject && ./TestProject
```

This command sequence will automatically build and run that CMake project. Enjoy!
